## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS modules
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I used letter spacing for the first time.

I learned how to use react leaflet, with a custom icon and flyTo capability.

I learned to use 'srcSet' not 'srcset' in picture/source element.

I styled first component in list differently by using map with index and passing index to the component and using conditional css styles.

I learned how to include api key in project by adding it to a very simple JS module not commited to source control.

### Continued development

I just want to continue to build more complex react.js apps and do it faster.
